Student Organizations
Taking part in student bodies should be an enjoyable and inspiring experience to realize your full potential as well as meeting new friends from other disciplines/ in other interest fields. Here, we have over 30 student societies to cope with your interests.

Art and Culture
While our School of Arts and Social Sciences organizes annual graduation show to showcase creative pieces of works by our creative arts students, we also set up a centre to promote Chinese culture to the University community and the public.
