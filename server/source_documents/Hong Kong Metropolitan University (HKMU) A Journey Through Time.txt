Hong Kong Metropolitan University (HKMU): A Journey Through Time

From Open Learning to Comprehensive Excellence
Hong Kong Metropolitan University (HKMU), formerly known as The Open University of Hong Kong, has a rich and transformative history. Let‚Äôs delve into the milestones that have shaped our institution:

Inception and Evolution
1989: The Government established the Open Learning Institute of Hong Kong (OLI), pioneering open and distance education. Our mission: ‚ÄúEducation for All.‚Äù
1997: OLI achieved university status and was renamed The Open University of Hong Kong. We continued our commitment to accessible education.
2001-2003: A significant shift occurred as we introduced our first full-time, face-to-face programs. Five Associate Degree programs in 2001 and a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in 2003 attracted fresh secondary school leavers.
Programmatic Growth and Industry Relevance
Program Expansion: From humble beginnings, we now offer around 220 programs comprising approximately 800 full-time and part-time courses. Our growth has been strategic, aligning with market trends and industry needs.
Professional Pathways: HKMU‚Äôs signature programs cater to diverse fields:
Creative Arts: Nurturing artistic talents.
Testing and Certification: Ensuring quality standards.
Nursing and Physiotherapy: Vital healthcare professions.
Energy and Environmental Studies: Addressing sustainability challenges.
Early Childhood Education: Shaping young minds.
Psychology: Understanding human behavior.
Corporate Governance: Enhancing business ethics.
Hospitality Management: Crafting exceptional experiences.
Government Recognition: Since 2015, some of our full-time programs have been included in the Study Subsidy Scheme for Designated Professions/Sectors (SSSDP). This subsidy supports students pursuing programs that address Hong Kong‚Äôs manpower shortages in specific industries.

Self-Financing Leader: We are the largest self-financing university in Hong Kong, having groomed over 140,000 graduates.
